Determination of degradation behavior at critical locations is important for the safety of gas turbine and blades refurbishment program. The microstructure characterization on the surface and interface of MCrAlY coated Ni-based superalloy blades have been studied. The microstructure evolution near the coating/ substrate interface was studied by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the difference in degradation of the main precipitates at several locations were quantified. Surface oxidation and interfacial diffusion were analyzed through energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) and electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA) to clarify the influence of elemental diffusion on microstructure. The results indicated that regional microstructure evolution influenced by the spatial structural characteristics of the blades. The migration of Ni, Al, Cr, and Co dominated the diffusion mechanism during service, and reconstructed the microstructure of the coating/substrate interface and surface.},

  abstract = {Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is perhaps the first technique a catalyst researcher should use to start characterizing a catalyst. In this chapter, we present an overview of instrumental considerations when studying heterogeneous catalysts via SEM, methods to achieve high resolution for imaging and elemental analysis, and applications and case studies highlighting the use of SEM for the study of catalysts. The SEM images show the morphology of the sample and provide elemental composition and an indication of the uniformity of the sample as well as information on pore structure and particle size at the micron scale. The ability to see the material over this length scale is critical to early identification of issues with catalyst preparation, such as poor distribution of the active components. Using a high-resolution SEM, or when possible, a STEM detector within the SEM, it is possible to achieve resolutions rivaling a TEM. Then it becomes possible to see individual pores, the size and morphology of nanoparticles, and their composition. SEM is also ideally suited to see exposed surface facets in nanoparticles. Sample preparation for SEM is so much easier than a TEM, since the sample can be simply sprinkled on an SEM stub. The disadvantage is that only the surface of the sample is visible. But one can probe deeper by generating cross sections of extrudates. Such cross sections can help in identifying the location of various components, such as, for example, when preparing eggshell morphologies where the active phase is present only in the near-surface region of an extrudate.},

  abstract = {Thermal barrier coatings are used to reduce the actual working temperature of the high pressure turbine blade metal surface and; hence permit the engine to operate at higher more efficient temperatures. Sensor coatings are an adaptation of existing thermal barrier coatings to enhance their functionality, such that they not only protect engine components from the high temperature gas, but can also measure the material temperature accurately and determine the health of the coating e.g., ageing, erosion and corrosion. The sensing capability is introduced by embedding optically active materials into the thermal barrier coatings and by illuminating these coatings with excitation light phosphorescence can be observed. The phosphorescence carries temperature and structural information about the coating. Accurate temperature measurements in the engine hot section would eliminate some of the conservative margins which currently need to be imposed to permit safe operation. A 50\,K underestimation at high operating temperatures can lead to significant premature failure of the protective coating and loss of integrity. Knowledge of the exact temperature could enable the adaptation of the most efficient coating strategies using the minimum amount of air. The integration of an on-line temperature detection system would enable the full potential of thermal barrier coatings to be realized due to improved accuracy in temperature measurement and early warning of degradation. This, in turn, will increase fuel efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions. Application: This paper describes the implementation of a sensor coating system on a Rolls-Royce jet engine. The system consists of three components: industrially manufactured robust coatings, advanced remote detection optics and improved control and readout software. The majority of coatings were based on yttria stabilized zirconia doped with Dy (dysprosium) and Eu (europium), although other coatings made of yttrium aluminum garnet were manufactured as well. Coatings were produced on a production line using atmospheric plasma spraying. Parallel tests at Didcot power station revealed survivability of specific coatings in excess of 4500 effective operating hours. It is deduced that the capability of these coatings is in the range of normal maintenance schedules of industrial gas turbines of 24,000 h or even longer. An advanced optical system was designed and manufactured permitting easy scanning of coated components and also the detection of phosphorescence on rotating turbine blades (13\,k rotations per minute) at stand-off distances of up to 400\,mm. Successful temperature measurements were taken from the nozzle guide vanes (hot), the combustion chamber (noisy) and the rotating turbine blades (moving) and compared with thermocouple and pyrometer installations for validation purposes.},

The main selection criteria for designing the complex alloy compositions are illustrated. Superalloys, since the early stages of their development, have gained an ever-increasing role in the fabrication of components of gas turbine aero-engines, owing to the excellent combination of structural properties and corrosion resistance, both retained up to relatively high temperatures. These aspects have been enhanced further by processing routes, like directional solidification and single-crystal investment casting. Through the elimination of grain boundaries perpendicular to the main stress axis, a significant reduction of the diffusive creep rate has been attained. Diffusive creep is one of the deformation mechanisms in the Ashby maps, discussed in this chapter, together with another physical metallurgy issue: the superalloy strengthening by the precipitation of ordered {$\gamma\prime$} phase. The microstructure of the superalloys and, thereby, their mechanical properties are usually refined by thermal treatments, whose main working principles are presented. Eventually the main applications of this fundamental class of alloys are introduced.},

The analysis of the EBSD patterns obtained indicates that the method appears to be applicable for investigating deformation in a chip root and is well suited for the analysis of the deformation zones ahead of the tool tip in the vicinity of the primary deformation zone Z1. Though the EBSD patterns (EBSPs) could not be resolved clearly in the chip in the case of materials displaying continuous chips (Remko iron, carbon steels), the analysis was more successful for materials exhibiting shear-localised chips such as austenitic steel, due to the presence of alternating low and high deformation zones. The presence of slip lines within the deformed grains in the austenitic chip material was clearly noticeable and also evidence of twinning deformation was found. The EBSD analysis of the machined surfaces indicated that the deepest heavily deformed area was found for the Remko iron material and the smallest for the austenitic variant. These results were also confirmed by microhardness profiling in the machined surfaces.},
