  abstract = {The large-sized industrial gas turbine blades exhibit non-uniform microstructural degradation in various parts due to ultra-long term service in high-temperature and high-pressure environments. Determination of degradation behavior at critical locations is important for the safety of gas turbine and blades refurbishment program. The microstructure characterization on the surface and interface of MCrAlY coated Ni-based superalloy blades have been studied. The microstructure evolution near the coating/ substrate interface was studied by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the difference in degradation of the main precipitates at several locations were quantified. Surface oxidation and interfacial diffusion were analyzed through energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) and electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA) to clarify the influence of elemental diffusion on microstructure. The results indicated that regional microstructure evolution influenced by the spatial structural characteristics of the blades. The migration of Ni, Al, Cr, and Co dominated the diffusion mechanism during service, and reconstructed the microstructure of the coating/substrate interface and surface.},

  abstract = {Thermal barrier coatings are used to reduce the actual working temperature of the high pressure turbine blade metal surface and; hence permit the engine to operate at higher more efficient temperatures. Sensor coatings are an adaptation of existing thermal barrier coatings to enhance their functionality, such that they not only protect engine components from the high temperature gas, but can also measure the material temperature accurately and determine the health of the coating e.g., ageing, erosion and corrosion. The sensing capability is introduced by embedding optically active materials into the thermal barrier coatings and by illuminating these coatings with excitation light phosphorescence can be observed. The phosphorescence carries temperature and structural information about the coating. Accurate temperature measurements in the engine hot section would eliminate some of the conservative margins which currently need to be imposed to permit safe operation. A 50\,K underestimation at high operating temperatures can lead to significant premature failure of the protective coating and loss of integrity. Knowledge of the exact temperature could enable the adaptation of the most efficient coating strategies using the minimum amount of air. The integration of an on-line temperature detection system would enable the full potential of thermal barrier coatings to be realized due to improved accuracy in temperature measurement and early warning of degradation. This, in turn, will increase fuel efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions. Application: This paper describes the implementation of a sensor coating system on a Rolls-Royce jet engine. The system consists of three components: industrially manufactured robust coatings, advanced remote detection optics and improved control and readout software. The majority of coatings were based on yttria stabilized zirconia doped with Dy (dysprosium) and Eu (europium), although other coatings made of yttrium aluminum garnet were manufactured as well. Coatings were produced on a production line using atmospheric plasma spraying. Parallel tests at Didcot power station revealed survivability of specific coatings in excess of 4500 effective operating hours. It is deduced that the capability of these coatings is in the range of normal maintenance schedules of industrial gas turbines of 24,000 h or even longer. An advanced optical system was designed and manufactured permitting easy scanning of coated components and also the detection of phosphorescence on rotating turbine blades (13\,k rotations per minute) at stand-off distances of up to 400\,mm. Successful temperature measurements were taken from the nozzle guide vanes (hot), the combustion chamber (noisy) and the rotating turbine blades (moving) and compared with thermocouple and pyrometer installations for validation purposes.},
