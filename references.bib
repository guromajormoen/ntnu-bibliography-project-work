  abstract = {The three main groups of superalloys, cobalt-, iron-, and nickel-based, are presented, with reference to their compositional and processing aspects. The main selection criteria for designing the complex alloy compositions are illustrated. Superalloys, since the early stages of their development, have gained an ever-increasing role in the fabrication of components of gas turbine aero-engines, owing to the excellent combination of structural properties and corrosion resistance, both retained up to relatively high temperatures. These aspects have been enhanced further by processing routes, like directional solidification and single-crystal investment casting. Through the elimination of grain boundaries perpendicular to the main stress axis, a significant reduction of the diffusive creep rate has been attained. Diffusive creep is one of the deformation mechanisms in the Ashby maps, discussed in this chapter, together with another physical metallurgy issue: the superalloy strengthening by the precipitation of ordered {$\gamma\prime$} phase. The microstructure of the superalloys and, thereby, their mechanical properties are usually refined by thermal treatments, whose main working principles are presented. Eventually the main applications of this fundamental class of alloys are introduced.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) as a disruptive technology has received much attention in recent years. In practice, however, much effort is focused on the AM of polymers. It is comparatively more expensive and more challenging to additively manufacture metallic parts due to their high temperature, the cost of producing powders, and capital outlays for metal additive manufacturing equipment. The main technology currently used by numerous companies in the aerospace and biomedical sectors to fabricate metallic parts is powder bed technology, in which either electron or laser beams are used to melt and fuse the powder particles line by line to make a three-dimensional part. Since this technology is new and also sought by manufacturers, many scientific questions have arisen that need to be answered. This manuscript gives an introduction to the technology and common materials and applications. Furthermore, the microstructure and quality of parts made using powder bed technology for several materials that are commonly fabricated using this technology are reviewed and the effects of several process parameters investigated in the literature are examined. New advances in fabricating highly conductive metals such as copper and aluminum are discussed and potential for future improvements is explored.},

Due to the complex shapes required for components in these application areas, additive manufacturing has become a promising option with its advantageous speed and precision. This study examined the impact of direct energy deposition (DED) and powder bed fusion (PBF) technologies on the resulting properties of the Ti--6Al--4V alloy. DED-produced samples showed almost fully dense structure, while PBF-produced ones were characterized by 0.3 \% residual porosity. In all states, the {$\alpha$} or {$\alpha\prime$} phase predominated in the material microstructure. The Ti--6Al--4V alloy produced by different additive manufacturing methods showed comparable hardness values in both, as-printed (380 HV) and as-printed~+~heat-treated (370 HV) states. However, the samples printed by the PBF method exhibited higher tensile strength and yield strength than those printed by the DED method. These values before and after stress-relief heat treatment differed by approximately 100~MPa. Conversely, the DED-printed material is more stable at elevated temperatures (up to 800~{$^\circ$}C) compared to the one printed by PBF.},

  abstract = {Laser cladding (LC) and laser metal deposition (LMD) can be innovative methods to current thermal spray techniques to obtain dense and high-quality bond coats using nickel- and cobalt-based superalloys in thermal barrier coating (TBC) systems for high-temperature applications. In this work, MCrAlY coatings (M~=~Ni~+~Co) were obtained on a stainless steel substrate using a coaxial LMD technique with two different Ni/Co and Al proportions. This chapter describes the development of the laser cladding process for such alloys by looking closely at the obtained microstructure and mechanical properties. Finally, the high-temperature oxidation behavior of the MCrAlY laser coatings is analyzed. The as-built resulting microstructure consists of {$\gamma$}-Ni/{$\beta$}-NiAl or {$\gamma$}-Co/{$\beta$}-(Co,Ni)Al phases, depending on the alloy's chemical composition. The {$\gamma$}/{$\beta$}-phases formed in the MCrAlY coating microstructure resulted in a lower elastic modulus than the austenitic stainless steel substrate, while an inverse behavior for hardness was observed due to the presence of the aluminum-rich {$\beta$}-phase. At high temperatures, the growth and formation of oxide layers protect the underlying coating and substrate from oxidation high temperatures. The possible formation and morphology of oxides on oxidized surfaces, and the evaluation of the thickness and phases present on thermally grown oxide (TGO) scales, were evaluated by advanced characterization techniques. The results show that the as-built microstructure of the laser cladding MCrAlY alloys plays an important role in the behavior of the coatings at high temperature.},

This review provides comprehensive new insights into CRM-containing materials processed by modern additive manufacturing techniques and outlines the potential for increasing the efficiency of CRMs utilization and reducing the dependence on CRMs through wider industrial incorporation of AM and specifics of powder bed AM methods making them prime candidates for such developments.},

Continued improvements in the properties of these materials have been possible through close control of chemistry and microstructure as well as the introduction of advanced processing technologies. Surface modification by application of coating technology concurrent with the introduction of directional structures and then single crystals, has extended the useful temperature range of superalloys. Further improvements are likely with the development and implementation of tools for alloy design, microstructure-process evolution, and mechanical-property modelling. To date, six generations of single crystal (SC) nickel-based superalloys have been developed with improved creep properties and phase stability. Therefore it appears that the evolution of advanced nickel-based superalloys is a never ending process, and their replacement in turbine engine applications seems to be impossible at least for a few more decades.

If an element exists only in the one side of the overlay coating system, the diffusion amount of that particular element becomes higher. The vacancies which formed near the substrate/coating interface after thermal exposure could be generated by the diffusion of Ni and Al. A seriously diffusion-affected zone between substrate and coating are observed within 80{$\mu$}m from the substrate/coating interface toward the coating surface. The cobalt-including CoCrAlYs and CoNiCrAlYs outperform the nickel-based system under the high temperature oxidizing condition.},

  abstract = {In this review, recent progress in understanding the short- and long-term oxidation behaviour of MCrAlY coatings and the instruments that can be employed to influence the oxidation behaviour of the MCrAlY's are discussed. Particular attention is given on the transient oxidation behaviour, the initial distribution of the Y in the oxide scale and how these initial oxide products influence the long-term oxide growth rate and adhesion of the oxide scale. It is shown that the growth kinetics and adhesion of the oxide scale are to a large extent determined by the amount and distribution of Y-oxide inclusions in the scale. Oxide scales with a regularly distributed and larger amount of small Y-oxide inclusions are faster growing, but perform better in thermal cycle tests. Transient oxide products like metastable aluminas ({$\gamma$}- or {\texttheta}-Al 2 O 3 ) and spinels do not have a large influence on long-term oxidation behaviour except when the oxide scale is virtually free of Y-oxide inclusions due to Y depletion. Then, the nucleation of metastable aluminas at the onset of oxidation may be beneficial due to a slower-growing alumina scale with a larger grain size after transformation into {$\alpha$}-Al 2 O 3 . Spinel oxides are considered detrimental for long-term oxidation performance, but their amount is usually limited on most types of MCrAlY coatings due to the rapid supply of Al along the numerous grain and phase boundaries in the fine-grained coatings. The key instruments that can be employed to manipulate the oxidation behaviour of MCrAlY coatings are: (i) the composition and size of the main phases in the coating ({$\gamma$}-Ni and {$\beta$}-NiAl), (ii) the initial distribution, chemical state (metallic or oxidized) and reservoir of the Y in the coating, (iii) the composition and roughness at the coating surface, and (iv) the oxidation conditions during post-deposition heat treatment (temperature, time, partial oxygen pressure).},

Eshelby tensor was calculated using the expressions for the case of anisotropic matrix given by Mura. Results show the presence of significant compressive misfit stresses in the {$\gamma{''}$} precipitates with an anisotropic distribution, namely 3.0 GPa along the habit plane and 1.7 GPa along the plane normal direction at room temperature, and 2.0 and 1.2 GPa at 664~{$^\circ$}C. The decrease in misfit stresses was due to the decrease in stiffness and the different coefficients of thermal expansion of the {$\gamma$} and {$\gamma{''}$} phases. The average internal stresses in the {$\gamma$} matrix due to lattice misfit were found to be {\textasciitilde}\,329~MPa at room temperature and {\textasciitilde}\,186~MPa at 664 {$^\circ$}C in tension.
