  abstract = {The three main groups of superalloys, cobalt-, iron-, and nickel-based, are presented, with reference to their compositional and processing aspects. The main selection criteria for designing the complex alloy compositions are illustrated. Superalloys, since the early stages of their development, have gained an ever-increasing role in the fabrication of components of gas turbine aero-engines, owing to the excellent combination of structural properties and corrosion resistance, both retained up to relatively high temperatures. These aspects have been enhanced further by processing routes, like directional solidification and single-crystal investment casting. Through the elimination of grain boundaries perpendicular to the main stress axis, a significant reduction of the diffusive creep rate has been attained. Diffusive creep is one of the deformation mechanisms in the Ashby maps, discussed in this chapter, together with another physical metallurgy issue: the superalloy strengthening by the precipitation of ordered {$\gamma\prime$} phase. The microstructure of the superalloys and, thereby, their mechanical properties are usually refined by thermal treatments, whose main working principles are presented. Eventually the main applications of this fundamental class of alloys are introduced.},

  abstract = {The term ``superalloysSuper-alloy'' refers to a group of alloys that are capable of maintaining their mechanical characteristicsMechanical characteristics after prolonged exposure to elevated temperatures. This category of material was primarily developed for applications such as turbo-superchargers and aircraft turbine engines. However, their applications have been expanded over the time to many other industrial sectors such as gas turbines, rocket engines, petroleum refineries, and chemical plants. From compositionComposition standpoint, among all of the metallic alloys ever developed for industrial, commercial, and military applications, superalloys are one of the most complex ones. This complexity enables metallurgistsMetallurgy to develop different alloys and tailor their characteristics for wide range of applications. In addition to their modifiable features, the growing demand of industry for heat-resistant materials has further boosted superalloys development to the present level of sophistication. This chapter provides the readers with a brief review of superalloys, history of evolution, and their current industrial applicationsIndustrial applications. It also presents the opportunities and challenges that may raise during machining superalloys. Applicable cutting toolsCutting tools, manufacturing processes, and other influential parameters on the machining and machinabilityMachinability of superalloys will also be discussed in this chapter.},

  abstract = {Superalloys are unique high-temperature materials used in gas turbine engines, which display excellent resistance to mechanical and chemical degradation. This book presents the underlying metallurgical principles which have guided their development and practical aspects of component design and fabrication from an engineering standpoint. The topics of alloy design, process development, component engineering, lifetime estimation and materials behaviour are described, with emphasis on critical components such as turbine blading and discs. The first introductory text on this class of materials, it will provide a strong grounding for those studying physical metallurgy at the advanced level, as well as practising engineers. Included at the end of each chapter are exercises designed to test the reader's understanding of the underlying principles presented. Solutions for instructors and additional resources are available at www.cambridge.org/9780521859042.},
