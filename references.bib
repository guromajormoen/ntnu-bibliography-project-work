  abstract = {The three main groups of superalloys, cobalt-, iron-, and nickel-based, are presented, with reference to their compositional and processing aspects. The main selection criteria for designing the complex alloy compositions are illustrated. Superalloys, since the early stages of their development, have gained an ever-increasing role in the fabrication of components of gas turbine aero-engines, owing to the excellent combination of structural properties and corrosion resistance, both retained up to relatively high temperatures. These aspects have been enhanced further by processing routes, like directional solidification and single-crystal investment casting. Through the elimination of grain boundaries perpendicular to the main stress axis, a significant reduction of the diffusive creep rate has been attained. Diffusive creep is one of the deformation mechanisms in the Ashby maps, discussed in this chapter, together with another physical metallurgy issue: the superalloy strengthening by the precipitation of ordered {$\gamma\prime$} phase. The microstructure of the superalloys and, thereby, their mechanical properties are usually refined by thermal treatments, whose main working principles are presented. Eventually the main applications of this fundamental class of alloys are introduced.},

  abstract = {The term ``superalloysSuper-alloy'' refers to a group of alloys that are capable of maintaining their mechanical characteristicsMechanical characteristics after prolonged exposure to elevated temperatures. This category of material was primarily developed for applications such as turbo-superchargers and aircraft turbine engines. However, their applications have been expanded over the time to many other industrial sectors such as gas turbines, rocket engines, petroleum refineries, and chemical plants. From compositionComposition standpoint, among all of the metallic alloys ever developed for industrial, commercial, and military applications, superalloys are one of the most complex ones. This complexity enables metallurgistsMetallurgy to develop different alloys and tailor their characteristics for wide range of applications. In addition to their modifiable features, the growing demand of industry for heat-resistant materials has further boosted superalloys development to the present level of sophistication. This chapter provides the readers with a brief review of superalloys, history of evolution, and their current industrial applicationsIndustrial applications. It also presents the opportunities and challenges that may raise during machining superalloys. Applicable cutting toolsCutting tools, manufacturing processes, and other influential parameters on the machining and machinabilityMachinability of superalloys will also be discussed in this chapter.},

This book presents the underlying metallurgical principles which have guided their development and practical aspects of component design and fabrication from an engineering standpoint. The topics of alloy design, process development, component engineering, lifetime estimation and materials behaviour are described, with emphasis on critical components such as turbine blading and discs. The first introductory text on this class of materials, it will provide a strong grounding for those studying physical metallurgy at the advanced level, as well as practising engineers. Included at the end of each chapter are exercises designed to test the reader's understanding of the underlying principles presented.

  abstract = {In this review, recent progress in understanding the short- and long-term oxidation behaviour of MCrAlY coatings and the instruments that can be employed to influence the oxidation behaviour of the MCrAlY's are discussed. Particular attention is given on the transient oxidation behaviour, the initial distribution of the Y in the oxide scale and how these initial oxide products influence the long-term oxide growth rate and adhesion of the oxide scale. It is shown that the growth kinetics and adhesion of the oxide scale are to a large extent determined by the amount and distribution of Y-oxide inclusions in the scale. Oxide scales with a regularly distributed and larger amount of small Y-oxide inclusions are faster growing, but perform better in thermal cycle tests. Transient oxide products like metastable aluminas ({$\gamma$}- or {\texttheta}-Al 2 O 3 ) and spinels do not have a large influence on long-term oxidation behaviour except when the oxide scale is virtually free of Y-oxide inclusions due to Y depletion. Then, the nucleation of metastable aluminas at the onset of oxidation may be beneficial due to a slower-growing alumina scale with a larger grain size after transformation into {$\alpha$}-Al 2 O 3 . Spinel oxides are considered detrimental for long-term oxidation performance, but their amount is usually limited on most types of MCrAlY coatings due to the rapid supply of Al along the numerous grain and phase boundaries in the fine-grained coatings. The key instruments that can be employed to manipulate the oxidation behaviour of MCrAlY coatings are: (i) the composition and size of the main phases in the coating ({$\gamma$}-Ni and {$\beta$}-NiAl), (ii) the initial distribution, chemical state (metallic or oxidized) and reservoir of the Y in the coating, (iii) the composition and roughness at the coating surface, and (iv) the oxidation conditions during post-deposition heat treatment (temperature, time, partial oxygen pressure).},
