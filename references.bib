  abstract = {Additive manufacturing is a recent trend in production processes owing to its many benefits. It can be defined as the process of producing parts through the deposition of material in a layer-by-layer fashion. It has been a topic of intense study and review by many researchers. In this work, a comprehensive review pertaining to additive manufacturing has been accomplished. The evolution of additive manufacturing as a prominent technology and its various phases are discussed. The importance of part orientation, build time estimation, and cost computation has also been reviewed. The remarkable aspect of this work is the identification of problems associated with different additive manufacturing methods. Because of the imperfections in additive manufacturing, its hybridization with other methods, such as subtractive manufacturing, has been emphasized. This review will help readers understand the different aspects of additive manufacturing and explore new avenues for future research.},

  abstract = {Metal additive manufacturing technologies, such as powder bed fusion process, directed energy deposition (DED) process, sheet lamination process, etc., are one of promising flexible manufacturing technologies due to direct fabrication characteristics of a metallic freeform with a three-dimensional shape from computer aided design data. DED processes can create an arbitrary shape on even and uneven substrates through line-by-line deposition of a metallic material. Theses DED processes can easily fabricate a heterogeneous material with desired properties and characteristics via successive and simultaneous depositions of different materials. In addition, a hybrid process combining DED with different manufacturing processes can be conveniently developed. Hence, researches on the DED processes have been steadily increased in recent years. This paper reviewed recent research trends of DED processes and their applications. Principles, key technologies and the state-of-the art related to the development of process and system, the optimization of deposition conditions and the application of DED process were discussed. Finally, future research issues and opportunities of the DED process were identified.},

  abstract = {Improvement in efficiencies of gas turbines can be achieved by increasing the gas inlet turbine temperature. This leads to increased blade and vane temperatures and therefore to enhanced oxidation and corrosion attack of the coatings on these components. Coatings such as MCrAlY are typically used to improve components' high temperature properties. Various processing routes have been studied to produce MCrAlY coatings including plasma spray and electrolysis methods. Plasma spray is convenient and permits a large range of MCrAlY composition to be obtained but the directionality of the process leads to non-uniformity of the coating thickness distribution. More recently, an electrolytic route has been developed using sulfamate or sulfate baths, which cause contamination of the coatings and has a detrimental effect on the adherence of the protective oxide scale. A potentially attractive processing route is the electroless autocatalytic process, since this has the advantage of permitting non-directional and sulfur-free deposition. We have investigated MCrAlY deposition by an electroless-like autocatalytic process. Coatings were deposited on a single crystal nickel-based alloy (MC-NG) and the differences in microstructure and phase composition according to the different process stages are reported. The influence of process parameters on the coating characteristics is discussed.},

  abstract = {Turbine blades are protected against high temperature oxidation by thermal barrier coating (TBC) systems, which consist of a ceramic top coating (ZrO2/Y2O3) and a metal bond coating (MCrAlY, M  Ni, Co). At high temperatures and under oxidative conditions, between the MCrAlY and the ceramic top coating an oxide scale is formed, which protects the metal against further oxidation. The oxidation behaviour of the thermally sprayed MCrAlY is influenced by the coating process and the composition of the metal alloys. This work is concerned with the isothermal oxidation behaviour of vacuum plasma sprayed (VPS) MCrAlY coatings. The MCrAlY powders used have different aluminium contents: 8 and 12 wt.\%. The MCrAlY specimens are oxidized at 1050 {$^\circ$}C in air as well as in helium with 1\% O2 and the oxidation kinetics are determined thermogravimetrically. The microstructure, morphology and thickness of the oxide scales formed are characterized by metallography, SEM, TEM and XRD. After short time oxidation (6 h) \texttheta -Al2O3 is the main constituent of the oxide scale. Exposure times of 500 h and more lead to oxide scales consisting of {$\alpha$}-Al2O3. Moreover, after a long time oxidation, Cr2O3 and CoO (CoO on the coatings with 8 wt.\% Al) are formed. The oxidation rates of both MCrAlY coatings are the same. Beneath the oxide scale an Al-depleted zone is formed and this zone is considerably thicker with the coating with 8 wt.\% Al, because the amount of {$\beta$}-NiAl phase in this coating is lower than that in the coating with 12 wt.\% Al. The oxide scale formed in He---1\% O2 consists of {$\alpha$}-Al2O3 and Cr2O3 on both MCrAlY coatings.},

The early oxidation behaviour of the coatings at 1150\,{$^\circ$}C is studied. For the LPPS coating with relative coarse grains, the {$\gamma$} and {$\beta$}-phase show different oxidation behaviours: the oxide on the {$\gamma$}-phase shows a multi-layer structure, consisting of outer (Ni,Co) (Cr,Al)2O4, intermediate (Cr,Al)2O3 and inner {$\alpha$}-Al2O3; the oxidation of the {$\beta$}-phase, however, is characterised by selective oxidation of aluminium and the oxide is composed of a mixture of \texttheta{} and {$\alpha$}-Al2O3. For the nanocrystalline HVOF coating, it does not show site-specific oxidation and the oxidation is characterised by formation of an exclusive {$\alpha$}-Al2O3 scale over the surface. The microstructure-dependent oxidation is quantitatively described from the perspective of oxidation kinetics, with contribution from both lattice and grain boundary diffusion taken into consideration. A critical grain size of the {$\gamma$}-phase, below which formation of an exclusive Al2O3 scale can be achieved, is predicted and verified.

The present paper reviews the main technique used in the synthesis of nano-crystalline NiCrAlY powders using a planetary ball mill and investigates the microstructural evolution of thermally grown oxide (TGO) layer on the conventional and nanostructured atmospheric plasma sprayed (APS) NiCrAlY coatings in thermal barrier coating (TBC) systems during oxidation. Microstructural characterization showed that the growth of Ni(Cr,Al)2O4 (as spinel) and NiO on the surface of Al2O3 layer (as pure TGO) in nano TBC system was much lower compared to that of normal TBC system during thermal exposure at 1150 \textopenbullet C. These two oxides play a detrimental role in causing crack nucleation and growth, reducing the life of the TBC in air. This microstructure optimization of TGO layer is primarily associated with the formation of a continuous, dense, uniform Al2O3 layer (at first 24 h of isothermal oxidation at 1000 \textopenbullet C) over the nanostructured NiCrAlY coating.},

The results showed that the conventional as-sprayed MCrAlY coating had a parabolic behavior in the early stage and prolonged oxidation process. On the contrary, in the case of the nanocrystalline MCrAlY coating, the long-term oxidation behavior has deviated from parabolic to sub-parabolic rate law. Moreover, the results also exemplified that the nanocrystalline MCrAlY coating had a greater oxidation resistance following the creation of a continuous and slow-growing Al2O3 scale with a fine-grained structure.

The main selection criteria for designing the complex alloy compositions are illustrated. Superalloys, since the early stages of their development, have gained an ever-increasing role in the fabrication of components of gas turbine aero-engines, owing to the excellent combination of structural properties and corrosion resistance, both retained up to relatively high temperatures. These aspects have been enhanced further by processing routes, like directional solidification and single-crystal investment casting. Through the elimination of grain boundaries perpendicular to the main stress axis, a significant reduction of the diffusive creep rate has been attained. Diffusive creep is one of the deformation mechanisms in the Ashby maps, discussed in this chapter, together with another physical metallurgy issue: the superalloy strengthening by the precipitation of ordered {$\gamma\prime$} phase. The microstructure of the superalloys and, thereby, their mechanical properties are usually refined by thermal treatments, whose main working principles are presented. Eventually the main applications of this fundamental class of alloys are introduced.},

During high temperature service the MCrAlY coatings form aluminium based surface oxide scales. The technologically most relevant properties of the oxide scales, growth rate and adherence do not only depend on the exact MCrAlY composition but also on the surface condition after coating manufacturing. Depending on the coating manufacturing process, the MCrAlY surfaces may substantially differ in roughness. In addition the coatings may be subjected to surface treatments (e.g. shot peening, grinding or smoothening prior to deposition of TBC). In the present work the effect of the surface roughness commonly prevailing in the case of vacuum plasma sprayed MCrAlY coatings on the morphology and composition of the alumina scales formed during high-temperature oxidation was studied. For this purpose free standing coatings with rough and polished surfaces were oxidised in the temperature range from 800 to 1100~{$^\circ$}C with exposure times up to 1000~h. The surface scale composition and morphology were analysed by optical metallography and SEM. Fluorescence spectroscopy was used for stress measurements in the oxide scales. It has been found that the oxide scales formed on rough surfaces of MCrAlY coatings have an intrinsically different morphology and growth rate compared to those formed on the flat ground surfaces.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) as a disruptive technology has received much attention in recent years. In practice, however, much effort is focused on the AM of polymers. It is comparatively more expensive and more challenging to additively manufacture metallic parts due to their high temperature, the cost of producing powders, and capital outlays for metal additive manufacturing equipment. The main technology currently used by numerous companies in the aerospace and biomedical sectors to fabricate metallic parts is powder bed technology, in which either electron or laser beams are used to melt and fuse the powder particles line by line to make a three-dimensional part. Since this technology is new and also sought by manufacturers, many scientific questions have arisen that need to be answered. This manuscript gives an introduction to the technology and common materials and applications. Furthermore, the microstructure and quality of parts made using powder bed technology for several materials that are commonly fabricated using this technology are reviewed and the effects of several process parameters investigated in the literature are examined. New advances in fabricating highly conductive metals such as copper and aluminum are discussed and potential for future improvements is explored.},

  abstract = {The present study investigated for the first time the feasibility of producing by Selective Laser Melting (SLM) a NiCrAlY bond coat material directly onto an IN625 substrate itself produced by SLM. A typical parameters optimization was conducted by varying laser power (P) and scanning speed (v). Single-line scanning tracks and two-layer coatings were carried out and analyzed for 15 different P/v conditions. Several criteria were defined for the selection of appropriate SLM parameters. The results showed significant remelting of the underlying substrate, which is a typical feature of SLM manufacturing. This led to the formation of an intermediate dilution zone characterized by substantial mixing between IN625 superalloy substrate and NiCrAlY bond coat suggesting excellent metallurgical bonding. Optimum processing conditions were found for P\,=\,250 W and v\,=\,800\,mm/s. It produced a dense 242\,{$\mu$}m thick bond coat including a 36\% dilution zone. The SLMed\,{$<$}\,NiCrAlY-IN625{$>$} system exhibited a smooth microhardness profile slightly increasing from 275 Hv in the bond coat to 305 Hv in the substrate. A progressive Al concentration distribution between the phases and low residual stress levels were found in the system. This suggested that SLM might be a valuable alternative manufacturing process for bond coat systems promoting excellent adhesion for high temperature applications.},

  abstract = {The ultra-high strength of high {$\gamma$}' nickel (Ni)-based superalloys with low ductility comes with the price of high susceptibility to cracking and a high residual stress state when processed with conventional powder bed fusion technologies. Binder jet additive manufacturing (BJAM) is an interesting alternative to other additive manufacturing (AM) modalities since it does not require melting to fuse powder material but selectively adheres powder with a binder. While there are several studies on the use of melting and solidification-based AM technologies, limited literature is available on the use of BJAM for high {$\gamma$}' Ni-based superalloys. This study presents the advantages and disadvantages associated with the BJAM of REN\'E~108 superalloy. The BJAM microstructure is characterized in the green, brown and sintered states. The formation of parallel primitive lines perpendicular to the build direction is observed after printing. This leads to persistent lines of porosity and a relative density above 96\% after a sintering cycle. A fully dense microstructure is obtained after hot isostatic pressing (HIP) of the material. The formation of HfO2 and Ta-rich carbides along prior particle boundaries (PPBs) is also observed during the sintering stage. Precipitation along PPBs is intrinsic to the powder metallurgy of Ni-based superalloys and influenced by the debinding conditions of the parts. They have a strong impact on the mechanical properties of the material. At low temperatures ({$<$}760~{$^\circ$}C), the deformation mode is transgranular, and the BJAM material has better tensile properties than the directional solidification (DS) material. At high temperatures ({$>$}760~{$^\circ$}C), the deformation becomes intergranular, and fracture occurs at the PPBs. The ductility of BJAM REN\'E~108 becomes slightly lower than the DS material while the strength of the materials remains comparable.},

The Ti--6Al--4V alloy produced by different additive manufacturing methods showed comparable hardness values in both, as-printed (380 HV) and as-printed~+~heat-treated (370 HV) states. However, the samples printed by the PBF method exhibited higher tensile strength and yield strength than those printed by the DED method. These values before and after stress-relief heat treatment differed by approximately 100~MPa. Conversely, the DED-printed material is more stable at elevated temperatures (up to 800~{$^\circ$}C) compared to the one printed by PBF.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of aerospace industry, the service temperature of the engine rises gradually, and the working environment gets worse. Turbine blades are easily oxidized in high temperature environment, which greatly reduces the service life of the blades. How to prepare high temperature protective coating with good protective performance at low cost is the focus of research in China and abroad, which is of great strategic significance to national defense security and national economic development. The work aims to present a comprehensive overview of research progress on MCrAlY coatings, which are widely used to protect substrates against oxidation and corrosion in high temperature environment. MCrAlY coating is subdivided into NiCrAlY coating, CoCrAlY coating and NiCoCrAlY coating. These three kinds of coatings have good oxidation resistance and corrosion resistance, as well as good plastic toughness and thermal fatigue resistance, so they can be used as bonding layer materials for coatings or thermal barrier coatings. The research progress on the properties of MCrAlY coating, such as the main elements (Al, Cr, Co, Y), the addition of alloy elements (Ta, Re, Si, Pt), the coating preparation process and the pretreatment process was reviewed. The results showed that different compositions and structures would affect the performance and application range of the coating. The control of coating properties could be realized by adjusting the composition of MCrAlY coating. The addition of alloy elements such as Si, Ta and Re into the MCrAlY coating could significantly improve the high temperature oxidation resistance of the coating, which was critical for improving the working efficiency of the engine and met the requirements of high temperature working environment. The preparation process and process parameters of the coating would affect its quality and stability. Moreover, various methods were summarized to improve the oxidation resistance and corrosion resistance of MCrAlY coatings, including refining the coating grain size, doping with nanoparticles and preparing gradient composite coatings. By optimizing the coating structure (coating thickness, grain size distribution, etc.), its oxidation resistance and corrosion resistance could be improved. The introduction of nanoparticles into the coating could improve its mechanical properties and spalling resistance. The development trend of MCrAlY coatings was prospected. In conclusion, MCrAlY coatings have exhibited excellent high temperature oxidation and corrosion resistance, making them suitable for harsh working environment. The properties of MCrAlY coatings can be controlled by adjusting their composition and utilizing advanced preparation and pretreatment processes. At present, due to the deterioration of the use environment, higher requirements are put forward for the use temperature of the coating, and the density and porosity of the coating need to be improved by one step. The future development direction of MCrAlY coating includes improving high temperature stability and mechanical properties, developing new coating materials, studying the preparation process and process parameters of coating, exploring its application in new fields, improving the precision control and consistency of coating, exploring the multifunctional application of coating, developing new coating preparation technology and promoting the digital design, prediction and simulation of coating. These directions will bring more opportunities and challenges to the application and development of MCrAlY coatings. \copyright{} 2024 Chongqing Wujiu Periodicals Press. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Laser cladding (LC) and laser metal deposition (LMD) can be innovative methods to current thermal spray techniques to obtain dense and high-quality bond coats using nickel- and cobalt-based superalloys in thermal barrier coating (TBC) systems for high-temperature applications. In this work, MCrAlY coatings (M~=~Ni~+~Co) were obtained on a stainless steel substrate using a coaxial LMD technique with two different Ni/Co and Al proportions. This chapter describes the development of the laser cladding process for such alloys by looking closely at the obtained microstructure and mechanical properties. Finally, the high-temperature oxidation behavior of the MCrAlY laser coatings is analyzed. The as-built resulting microstructure consists of {$\gamma$}-Ni/{$\beta$}-NiAl or {$\gamma$}-Co/{$\beta$}-(Co,Ni)Al phases, depending on the alloy's chemical composition. The {$\gamma$}/{$\beta$}-phases formed in the MCrAlY coating microstructure resulted in a lower elastic modulus than the austenitic stainless steel substrate, while an inverse behavior for hardness was observed due to the presence of the aluminum-rich {$\beta$}-phase. At high temperatures, the growth and formation of oxide layers protect the underlying coating and substrate from oxidation high temperatures. The possible formation and morphology of oxides on oxidized surfaces, and the evaluation of the thickness and phases present on thermally grown oxide (TGO) scales, were evaluated by advanced characterization techniques. The results show that the as-built microstructure of the laser cladding MCrAlY alloys plays an important role in the behavior of the coatings at high temperature.},

  abstract = {The role and behavior of primary MC carbide and their effects on the microstructure and stress rupture property of the cast Ni-based superalloys during long-term thermal exposure at elevated temperature are systemically investigated in this work. It is found that the chemical compositions of primary MC are proportional to the Nb/Ti and (Ti + Nb)/(Mo + W) ratios of alloys. During long-term thermal exposure, the thermal stability of primary MC can be quantitatively evaluated by its decomposition degree defined as Dt=(V0-Vt)/V0 \texttimes{} 100\%, which is closely associated with the Nb/Ti and (Mo + W)/Cr ratios of alloys. The decomposition process, degree, form and mechanism of primary MC are revealed in detail. The STEM observations with the EDS analyses show that primary MC decomposition is an inter-diffusion process of elements between the primary MC carbide and {$\gamma$} matrix, which can increase the volume fraction of {$\gamma$}' phase, restrain the precipitation of topologically closepacked (TCP) phases and promote the coarsening of grain boundaries (GBs). The combination of these microstructural evolutions, together with the appropriate Al + Ti + Nb and W + Mo contents in the matrix, eventually results in a remarkable improvement in the stress rupture property of long-term thermally exposed cast Ni-based superalloys.},

During such process, in which the stacking of layers occurs, the complex thermal activity of metal deposition affects the part geometry, microstructure, physical and mechanical properties. The correlation between deposition path, bead stepover, and the direct effect on the part density, microstructure and geometry distortions are yet to be found in the literature. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of deposition paths and bead stepover on the final part geometry form, microhardness and density. In order to do so, four deposition paths (linear, zigzag, chessboard and contour) and beads stepover of 0.44 mm and 0.55 mm were performed on the production of Stainless Steel 316L cubes by a 5-axis laser based DED BeAM Machine Magic800 with laser spot size of 0.80 mm. The paths shown considerable influence on the variation of both final part geometry and density. Contour (spiral-like) was the path, which produced workpieces with finer form and finishing, with density and microhardness closer to the conventional AISI 316L material. The bead stepover was also found to influence the surface finishing, as larger critical valleys between adjacent beads were noticed when using the higher stepover value.},

  abstract = {Nickel-based superalloys are an exceptional class of structural materials for high temperature applications, particularly in the challenging environment of the turbine sections of aircraft engines. Continued improvements in the properties of these materials have been possible through close control of chemistry and microstructure as well as the introduction of advanced processing technologies. Surface modification by application of coating technology concurrent with the introduction of directional structures and then single crystals, has extended the useful temperature range of superalloys. Further improvements are likely with the development and implementation of tools for alloy design, microstructure-process evolution, and mechanical-property modelling. To date, six generations of single crystal (SC) nickel-based superalloys have been developed with improved creep properties and phase stability. Therefore it appears that the evolution of advanced nickel-based superalloys is a never ending process, and their replacement in turbine engine applications seems to be impossible at least for a few more decades. The present chapter is a brief review of various aspects pertaining to chemical composition, heat treatment, microstructure, properties and applications of both cast, and wrought alloys as well as the evolution of advanced cast nickel-based superalloys.},

  abstract = {Complex components for high-temperature gas turbine applications require materials that offer a combination of excellent high-temperature strength and oxidation resistance. Nickel-based superalloys with high gamma prime ({$\gamma$}\textasciiacute ) volume fractions are particularly suited for these applications, especially combined with additive manufacturing for intricate geometries. Despite the complex thermal history that these materials experience during laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) processing, {$\gamma$}\textasciiacute formation is suppressed when manufacturing IN738LC, which has a medium equilibrium {$\gamma$}\textasciiacute content of about 40--50~vol\%. This study follows {$\gamma$}\textasciiacute formation in LPBF IN738LC during subsequent annealing treatments at temperatures ranging from 745~{$^\circ$}C to 865~{$^\circ$}C, creating an experimentally determined TTT (temperature-time-transformation) diagram. This diagram is largely based on scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging supported by Vickers hardness measurements and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) bright field imaging. Atom probe tomography (APT) of the as-built material indicated nm-sized regions depleted in Cr and enriched in Ni, Al, and Ti, but show no characteristic superlattice patterns in TEM diffraction. APT and TEM diffraction analysis of material annealed at 850~{$^\circ$}C for 3~min confirmed the presence of the {$\gamma$}\textasciiacute phase but indicated that {$\gamma$}\textasciiacute had formed through spinodal decomposition instead of precipitation.},

Emphasis is placed upon the influence of chemical composition on the oxidation. The results show that the oxide scale formation on coatings is considerably influenced by the microstructure of coating, the chemical composition of M as well as CrAlY, and the interdiffusion from substrate. If an element exists only in the one side of the overlay coating system, the diffusion amount of that particular element becomes higher. The vacancies which formed near the substrate/coating interface after thermal exposure could be generated by the diffusion of Ni and Al. A seriously diffusion-affected zone between substrate and coating are observed within 80{$\mu$}m from the substrate/coating interface toward the coating surface. The cobalt-including CoCrAlYs and CoNiCrAlYs outperform the nickel-based system under the high temperature oxidizing condition.},

The average thicknesses of oxide scale and internal oxidation zone of the substrate with coating are significantly smaller compared with the bare substrate. The TGO layer evolves from a black single-layer to a double-layer structure. The lower black layer is composed of {$\alpha$}-Al2O3, and the upper gray layer consists of mixed oxides of (Ni,Co)O, (Co,Ni)Cr2O4 and (Ni,Co)Al2O4 at 1000~{$^\circ$}C by TEM analysis. The formation of the solid solution oxides is probably related to the intense diffusion at high temperature. The growth stresses of {$\alpha$}-Al2O3, NiCr2O4, NiO and CoO are calculated to be 30.88, 62.99, 34.52 and 35.85~GPa, respectively, indicating that mixed oxides, especially the spinel phase, are very detrimental to the stability of the TBC.

  abstract = {Direct energy deposition is an additive manufacturing technique that involves the melting of metal powder with a high-powered laser beam and is used to build a variety of components. In laser-assisted metal deposition, the mechanical and metallurgical properties achieved are influenced by many factors. This paper addresses methods for selecting an appropriate layer thickness setting, which is an important parameter in layer-by-layer deposition manufacturing. A new procedure is proposed for determining the layer thickness setting for use in slicing of a part based on the single-layer height for a given depositing condition. This procedure was compared with a conventional method that uses an empirically determined layer thickness and with a feedback control method. The micro-hardness distribution, location of the melting pool, and microstructures of the deposited layers after deposition of a simple target shape were investigated for each procedure. The experimental results show that even though the feedback control method is the most effective method for obtaining the desired geometry, the deposited region was characterized by inhomogeneity of micro-hardness due to the time-variable depositing conditions involved. The largest dimensional error was associated with the conventional deposition procedure, which produced a rise in the melting zone due to over-deposition with respect to the slicing thickness, especially at the high laser power level considered. In contrast, the proposed procedure produced a stable melting zone position during deposition, which resulted in the deposited part having reasonable dimensional accuracy and uniform micro-hardness throughout the deposited region.},

  abstract = {In this review, recent progress in understanding the short- and long-term oxidation behaviour of MCrAlY coatings and the instruments that can be employed to influence the oxidation behaviour of the MCrAlY's are discussed. Particular attention is given on the transient oxidation behaviour, the initial distribution of the Y in the oxide scale and how these initial oxide products influence the long-term oxide growth rate and adhesion of the oxide scale. It is shown that the growth kinetics and adhesion of the oxide scale are to a large extent determined by the amount and distribution of Y-oxide inclusions in the scale. Oxide scales with a regularly distributed and larger amount of small Y-oxide inclusions are faster growing, but perform better in thermal cycle tests. Transient oxide products like metastable aluminas ({$\gamma$}- or \texttheta -Al 2 O 3 ) and spinels do not have a large influence on long-term oxidation behaviour except when the oxide scale is virtually free of Y-oxide inclusions due to Y depletion. Then, the nucleation of metastable aluminas at the onset of oxidation may be beneficial due to a slower-growing alumina scale with a larger grain size after transformation into {$\alpha$}-Al 2 O 3 . Spinel oxides are considered detrimental for long-term oxidation performance, but their amount is usually limited on most types of MCrAlY coatings due to the rapid supply of Al along the numerous grain and phase boundaries in the fine-grained coatings. The key instruments that can be employed to manipulate the oxidation behaviour of MCrAlY coatings are: (i) the composition and size of the main phases in the coating ({$\gamma$}-Ni and {$\beta$}-NiAl), (ii) the initial distribution, chemical state (metallic or oxidized) and reservoir of the Y in the coating, (iii) the composition and roughness at the coating surface, and (iv) the oxidation conditions during post-deposition heat treatment (temperature, time, partial oxygen pressure).},

If we do not have the appropriate materials, it can only be making bricks without straw even with the advanced 3D printer. Therefore, the main development direction of additive manufacturing, such as 3D printing, is using new special consumables materials. 3D printing is relatively easy to metals and difficult to high strength alloys, 3D printing is relatively more difficult to some ceramics, and may be harder to the nano ceramics. To solve the problems of 3D printing materials, such as limited properties and applications, some new nano modifier 3D printing materials are prepared. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), microhardness and friction and wear tests are used to characterize the obtained NiCrAlY, WC10Co-4Cr and ceramic powders and coatings. The results show that the optimized process can be used to prepare the nano modifier materials successfully. The coatings have high bonding strength and good wear resistance. Nano-modification and nanostructured spherical particles powder makes it possible for the preparation of high strength alloy materials even nano ceramic materials through 3D printing.},

In this paper, an oxidation-diffusion model was used to simulate the diffusion of alloying elements and the corresponding microstructural changes in different superalloy-coating systems at high temperature. Two important processes are considered in this model: oxidation of the coating and interdiffusion between the superalloy and the coating. The model showed an accurate predictability of the diffusion and microstructural evolution in real superalloy-coating diffusion couples studied at high-temperature exposure. The model was further applied to investigate the elemental effects of Ni, Co, Cr and Al on the microstructural evolution, considering the development of two important phases in superalloys and coatings, i.e. FCC-{$\gamma\prime$} and BCC-{$\beta$}, at different temperatures. The results in this paper deepen the knowledge of the MCrAlY coating design for superalloy-coating systems in high-temperature applications.},
